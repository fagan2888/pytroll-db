Here we keep the Data base design and code.

So far only a first draft database design (xml) done with pgDesigner
and some example code to verify it.

pgDesigner makes sql code automatically. However, there is (yet) no support for postGIS.
We need to make a small script that will take the automatically generated sql code
from pgDesigner and insert the geography specific parameters/tags for postGIS.

So far the automatically generated sql code has been adapted manually to comply with postGIS.
